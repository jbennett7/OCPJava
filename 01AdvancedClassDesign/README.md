# Exam Essentials
## Be able to identify the output of code using `instanceof`
`instanceof` checks if the left operand is the same class
or interface (or a subclass) as the right operand. If the
left operand is `null`, the result is `false`. If the two
operands are not in the same class hierarchy, the code will
not compile.

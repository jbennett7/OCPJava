# Exam Essentials
## Be able to identify the output of code using `instanceof`
`instanceof` checks if the left operand is the same class
or interface (or a subclass) as the right operand. If the
left operand is `null`, the result is `false`. If the two
operands are not in the same class hierarchy, the code will
not compile.

## Recognize correct and incorrect implementations of equals(), hashCode(), and toString()
`public boolean equals(Object obj)` returns `false` when called
`null` or a class of the wrong type. `public int hashCode()`
returns a number calculated with all or some of the instance
variables used in `equals()`. `public String toString()`
returns any `String`.

## Be able to create enum classes
`enums` have a list of values. If that is all that is in the `enum`,
the semicolon after the values is optional. Enums can have instance
variables, constructors, and methods. The constructors are required to
be private or packaged private. Methods are allowed to be on the enum
top level or in the individual `enum` values. If the `enum` declares an
`abstract` method, each `enum` value must implement it.

## Identify and use nested classes
A member inner class is instantiated with code such as outer.new Inner();
Local inner classes are scoped to the end of the current block of code
and are not allowed to have `static` members. Anonymous inner classes are
limited to extending a class or implementing one `interface`. A semicolon
must end the statement creating an anonymous inner class. Static nested
classes cannot access the enclosing class instance variables.

## Know how to use imports and static imports
Classes can be imported by class name or wildcard. Wildcards do not look
at subdirectories. In the event of a conflict, class name imports take
precedence. Static imports import static members. They are written as
`import static`, not `static import`. Make sure that they are importing
static methods or variables rather than class names.

## Understand the rules for method overriding and overloading
The Java compiler allows methods to be overridden in subclasses if
certain rules are followed: a method must have the same signature, be at
least as accessible as the parent method, must not declare any new or
broader exceptions, and must use covariant return types. Methods are
overloaded if they have the same method name but a different argument list.
An overriden method may use the optional `@Override` annotation.
